# What is PURE ONYX?

PURE ONYX is a classic beat â€˜em up with RPG elements set in the world of our flagship title, *Malice and the Machine*. It follows heroine Onyx as she brawls her way through the dystopian streets of New Babylon, where she'll encounter gangs, crime syndicates, a corrupt police force, and the bio-engineered horrors of the insidious Bubel Corporation. It features fully animated 30 ort and is styled after 80s cyberpunk anime. PURE ONYX contains in-game, fully animated H content.
